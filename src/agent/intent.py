"""Lightweight rule-based intent classifier.

Exposes :func:`classify_intent`, which maps a free-form user message to one
of four labels:

* ``'FAQ'``          — a direct factual / how-to question that the agent can
                       answer from its knowledge base (e.g. *"What are your
                       business hours?"*, *"How do I reset my password?"*).
* ``'SEARCH'``       — the user is asking the agent to look something up or
                       pull external resources (e.g. *"Find me articles
                       about machine learning"*).
* ``'CLARIFY'``      — the message is too ambiguous to act on and the agent
                       should ask a follow-up question (e.g. *"Tell me about
                       it"*, *"What about that thing?"*).
* ``'OUT_OF_SCOPE'`` — the message is unrelated to the agent's domain and
                       should be declined (e.g. *"Make me a sandwich"*).

The classifier is intentionally simple: a sequence of compiled regex
patterns evaluated in priority order. Patterns higher in the chain win over
later ones, so broad intents (``OUT_OF_SCOPE`` as the implicit fallback) are
checked last. New patterns can be appended to the relevant tuple without
touching the matching logic.

# the label, so the order between groups (CLARIFY -> SEARCH -> FAQ ->
# OUT_OF_SCOPE) matters: CLARIFY patterns must run before generic FAQ
# patterns, and SEARCH patterns before FAQ ones, to avoid mis-labelling
# vague references or look-up requests as direct questions.
